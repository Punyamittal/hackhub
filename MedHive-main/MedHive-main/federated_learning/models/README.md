# Federated Learning Models

This directory contains model implementations for different healthcare use cases. Each subdirectory contains a specific model type, with standardized files that allow them to be used in the federated learning framework.

## Model Types

The following model types are available:

### Breast Cancer

Models for breast cancer detection and classification from medical imaging.

### ECG Analysis

Models for analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) data to detect cardiac abnormalities.

### Glaucoma

Models for detecting glaucoma from retinal images.

### Pneumonia

Models for detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays.

### Symptom Analysis

Models for analyzing patient symptoms and predicting potential conditions.

## Directory Structure

Each model directory follows a standard structure:

```
model_type/
├── dataset.py       # Dataset implementation for loading and preprocessing data
├── model.py         # Model architecture definition
├── hyperparams.py   # Hyperparameters for training
├── evaluate.py      # Evaluation functions
└── README.md        # Documentation specific to this model
```

## Standard Files

### dataset.py

This file contains a `CustomDataset` class that inherits from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. It handles loading and preprocessing data specific to the model type.

```python
class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data_path, train=True):
        # Initialize dataset
        pass
        
    def __len__(self):
        # Return dataset size
        pass
        
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        # Get an item from the dataset
        pass
```

### model.py

This file contains the model architecture definition as a `Model` class that inherits from `torch.nn.Module`.

```python
class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize model architecture
        pass
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Forward pass
        pass
```

### hyperparams.py

This file contains a dictionary of hyperparameters for training the model.

```python
HYPERPARAMS = {
    "learning_rate": 0.001,
    "batch_size": 32,
    "epochs": 10,
    "optimizer": "adam",
    "loss_function": "cross_entropy",
    "weight_decay": 0.0001,
}
```

### evaluate.py

This file contains functions for evaluating the model on a test dataset.

```python
def evaluate_model(model_path, test_data_path):
    # Load model and test data
    # Evaluate model
    # Return metrics
    pass
```

## Adding a New Model

To add a new model type, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory with the model type name
2. Implement the standard files: dataset.py, model.py, hyperparams.py, evaluate.py
3. Add documentation in a README.md file

Make sure the implementations follow the standard interface so they can be used with the federated learning framework.
